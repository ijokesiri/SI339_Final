                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Shania! Welcome to my website, a space I created to share my love 
                    for cooking and my passion for technology. Here, you'll find a collection 
                    of hand-picked recipes that are as easy to follow as they are delicious, curated 
                    to inspire everyone from seasoned chefs to kitchen beginners.

                    Cooking has always been a source of joy for me—it’s about more than just making 
                    meals; it’s about creating connections, exploring cultures, and celebrating the 
                    art of food. Alongside my love for cooking, I’ve developed a strong passion for web 
                    development. I believe the internet should be a space where everyone can connect, learn, 
                    and grow, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds. That’s why I’ve worked hard to 
                    make this website not only visually engaging but also fully accessible to all users.
                    
                    This project combines my favorite things: creativity, problem-solving, and sharing with others. 
                    Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the recipes and features I’ve built. 
                    Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as I continue to grow and improve. Let’s make 
                    cooking—and the web—more fun and inclusive, together!

                    pancake recipes you can get your hands on! Just 5 ingredients and
                    5 minutes to have hot buttermilk pancakes from scratch on the
                    griddle. I would also like to think they will be the best pancakes you have ever eaten!</p>
